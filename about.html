    <h3>
        My name is Derek Earl, and I am Web Developer orginally from Baskin, Lousiana but currently living in Meridian, Idaho.
        I graduated from Mangham High School and a couple of years later at age 20, I was a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ 
        of Latter-day Saints in Bahia Blanca, Argentina where I lived their for two years giving service, teaching people, and helped
        in any way that was needed.

        After my mission was over, I moved back to Louisiana and worked at a hardware store (mostly in the lumber shed). After about 10 months
        of working and saving money for college, I moved up to Rexburg, Idaho and pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering
        specializing in the best field ever, Web Design and Development!

        It was in college where I met my wife Hailee.
